/**
 * Alien Dictionary (hard)
 *
 * There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the
 * characters. Write a method to find the correct order of characters in the alien language.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
 * Output: bac
 * Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
 * from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
 *
 * 1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
 * 2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
 *
 * From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: Words: ["cab", "aaa", "aab"]
 * Output: cab
 * Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
 *
 * 1. From "cab" and "aaa", we can conclude that 'c' comes before 'a'.
 * 2. From "aaa" and "aab", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'b'
 *
 * From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "cab"
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
 * Output: ywxz
 * Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
 *
 * 1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
 * 2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
 * 3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
 * 4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
 * 5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'
 *
 * From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "ywxz"
