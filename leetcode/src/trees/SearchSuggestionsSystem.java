/**
 * 1268. Search Suggestions System
 * Medium
 *
 * Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design a system that suggests at most three
 * product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common
 * prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three
 * lexicographically minimums products.
 *
 * Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
 * Output: [
 * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
 * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
 * ["mouse","mousepad"],
 * ["mouse","mousepad"],
 * ["mouse","mousepad"]
 * ]
 * Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
 * After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
 * After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
 * Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
 * Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
 * Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= products.length <= 1000
 * There are no repeated elements in products.
 * 1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4
 * All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters.
 * 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
 * All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.
