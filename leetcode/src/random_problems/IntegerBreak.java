/**
 * 343. Integer Break
 * Medium
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of
 * those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 Ã— 1 = 1.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: 10
 * Output: 36
 * Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 4 = 36.
 * Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
